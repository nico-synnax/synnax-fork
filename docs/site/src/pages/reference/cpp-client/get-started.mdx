## Pre-Built Binaries

Pre-built binaries for the C++ client are available on the [Synnax GitHub
Releases](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/releases) page. Corresponding
binaries for each platform are available for each release, and header files are
available in the `include` directory.

## Building from Source

There are two ways to build the C++ client from source, depending on your build system
of choice.

### Using CMake

To build the C++ client using CMake, you will need to have the following dependencies
installed:

- CMake
- A C++ compiler

Once you have the dependencies installed, you can build the C++ client using the
following command:

```bash
cmake -Bbuild -H.
make -C build
```

### Using Bazel

To build the C++ client using Bazel, you will need to have the following dependencies
installed:

- Bazel
- A C++ compiler

Once you have the dependencies installed, you can include the following in your `MODULE.bazel`
file:

```bzl
bazel_dep(name = "synnax_client", version = "0.38.0")
```

## Authenticating with a Cluster

To connect to a Synnax cluster, we'll instantiate `synnax::Synnax` with our connection
parameters to the cluster.

```cpp
#include "client/cpp/synnax.h"


auto client = synnax::Synnax(synnax::Config{
    .host = "localhost",
    .port = 9090,
    .username = "synnax",
    .password = "seldon",
    .secure = true
});
auto err = client.authenticate();
if (err) {
    // handle error
}
```
