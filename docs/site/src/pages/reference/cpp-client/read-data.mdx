The C++ client supports several different ways of reading data from a cluster. We can
read directly from a channel, fetch a range and access its data, or leverage server side
iterators for processing large queries. If you'd like a conceptual overview of how to
read data in Synnax, check out the [reads](/reference/concepts/reads) page.

## Reading from a Channel

The simplest way to read data from Synnax is to use the `read` method on the `Channel`
class:

```cpp
auto now = telem::Timestamp::now();
auto start = now - 10 * telem::SECOND;
auto end = now;

auto [data, err] = channel.read(start, end);
if (err) {
    // handle error
}
```

The returned data is an instance of the `synnax::Series` class.

## Reading From Multiple Channels

We can also read from multiple channels at once by calling the `read` method on
the `client`. This method takes a list of channel names/keys and a time range:

```cpp
auto [data, err] = client.read(start, end, {"ch1", "ch2"});
```

The returned data is an instance of the `synnax::Frame` class. We can access `Series`
on the class by using the `[]` operator:

## Reading with Iterators

Single, multiple, and named reads will cover most use cases, but there are situations
where it's necessary to process more data than can be stored in memory.

Synnax supports server side iterators that allow us to process large queries in
consistently sized chunks. By default, Synnax uses a chunk size of 100,000. To configure
a custom chunk size, pass in the `chunk_size` argument to the `open_iterator` method
with the desired number of samples per iteration.

```cpp
auto [it, err] = client.telem.open_iterator(start, end, {"ch1", "ch2"}, 100000);
```

The iterator will return a `synnax::Frame` for each iteration. We can access the
`Series` on the frame by using the `[]` operator:

```cpp
auto series = frame["ch1"];
```
